## Project Description
There are three major cheerleading score sheets that will be used for the 2023-2024 season of cheerleading. While the routines for the cheerleaders largely do not change from week to week the coaches need to be able to see how points are awarded with the different scoresheets and what, if any, tweaks need to be made to the routine in order to score higher.
